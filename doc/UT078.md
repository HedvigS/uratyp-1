**Are there case categories only found in pronouns?**

The same way as case inventories can vary in a language (from two to dozens) different words or word classes may display different number of cases, e.g. nouns may distinguish more cases than adjectives (Bickel and Nichols 2007: 210). The aim of this question is to find out wether pronouns stand out by revealing case categories not found with other word classes (e.g. with nouns or adjectives). For instance, the accusative case in Finnish is only used with pronouns, e.g. cf. the case marking of *sinä* 'you' and *kirja* 'book':

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Minä halua-n **sinu-t** / kirja-n*<br/>
>1SG want-1SG you-ACC / book-GEN<br/>
>’I want you / the book’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if pronouns reveal a case category that cannot be find with other word classes; otherwise the answer i '0'.
