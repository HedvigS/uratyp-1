**Is there a locative case that marks location?**

Goal, location, and source may be coded by different cases (see also UT086 and UT088). This question asks whether there is a separate case to mark location. For example, in Finnish there are two such local cases (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Ole-n talo-**ssa** / talo-**lla***<br/>
>be-1SG house-INE / house-ADE<br/>
>‘I am in the house.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such local case that marks location. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case marking also has another locative function (it marks goal or source). For instance, in Livvi-Karelian *lattiel* expresses 'on the floor' and 'rom the floor'. Thus, the case marked with *-l* cannot be said to have only one function.
