**Is there a locative case that marks location?**

It is possible that there are separate cases to mark GOAL, LOCATION, and SOURCE. This question asks is there a separate case to mark LOCATION, which does not overlap with the marking of GOAL and/or SOURCE. In Finnish there are two such cases (1).

>*Ole-n talo-**ssa** / talo-**lla***<br/>
>be-1SG house-INE / house-ADE<br/>
>‘I am in a/the house.’

To compare, the Livvi-Karelian *lattiel* is used to express 'on the floor, from the floor'. Thus,*-l* cannot be said to have only one function. 

The answer is '1', if there is at least one such local case that marks LOCATION. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case marking also has another locative function (to mark GOAL or SOURCE).
