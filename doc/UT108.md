**When used as a relative pronoun, is it common to use 'who' for inanimates?**

The relative clause may be introduced by a pronoun. This question asks whether there is an interrogative pronoun 'who' that can be used as a relative pronoun referring to inanimates. For instance, in the South Estonian example *kiä* 'who' refers to an inanimate object:

> South Estonian (Seto)<br/>
>*kivi man om kistavars´, **kiä** kivvi .ümbre aas*<br/>
>mill at be.3SG lever who millstone.PRT around whirl.3SG<br/>
>’At the mill there is a lever that makes the millstone whirl’ 

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if the interrogative pronoun 'who' also functions as a relative pronoun and it can be used with inanimates. The answer is '0' if the respective pronoun cannot be used this way or there is a different pronoun (e.g. 'what') used instead.
