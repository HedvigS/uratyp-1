**When used as a relative pronoun, is it common to use 'who' for inanimates?**

Relative clauses may be introduced by a pronoun. This question asks whether there is an interrogative pronoun, which is primarily used for animates ('who'), that can also function as a relative pronoun referring to inanimates. For instance, the South Estonian *kiä* 'who' can be found in such a function:

> South Estonian (Seto)<br/>
>*kivi man om kistavars´, **kiä** kivvi .ümbre aas*<br/>
>mill at be.3SG lever who millstone.PRT around whirl.3SG<br/>
>’At the mill there is a lever that makes the millstone whirl’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the interrogative pronoun 'who' functions as a relative pronoun and it can be used with inanimates. The answer is '0' if the respective pronoun cannot be used this way or a different pronoun (or 'what') is used instead.
