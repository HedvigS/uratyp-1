**Is there morphological marking for irrealis (e.g. hypothetical state of affairs)?**

It is possible to distinguish between events that have actualized (*realis*) and events that can only be imagined or wished for (*irrealis*) (Mithun 1995). This question asks   whether morphological marking is used to encode events regarded as nonactualized; see conditional marking used in Estonian example (1). Various terms may be used, e.g. *conditional*, *conjunctive*, *subjunctive*.

>*Ma ela-ksi-n maa-l, kui saa-ksi-n*<br/>

>'I would live in the countryside if I could' 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if morphological marking is used to denote events regarded as nonactualized.<br/>
