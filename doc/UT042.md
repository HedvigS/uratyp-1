**Are clauses with only infinitive predicates possible?**

A finite verb might not be required as a predicate to form a complete sentence, a non-finite verb may also be used. Although also converbs and participles are non-finite forms, this question asks whether an infinitive can form a predicate. In Estonian, the infinitive may be used in such a way to give an evidnetial meaning (1).

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>Ta olla kodu-s.<br/>
>s/he be-INF home-INE<br/>
>'S/he is said to be at home'

The answer is '1' if an infinitive can be used in the main clause to form a predicate. Participles and converbs were not considered as there are separate questions on them.
