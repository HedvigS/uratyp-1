**Is there a grammatical device for immediate future?**

It is possible for a language to have more than one future time reference device that has future as a use. As a result there might be a separate device for expressing the immediate future. (Bybee et al. 1994) In the case of immediate future, an event is about to take place. In Estonian there is a periphrastic device to encode this (1), while in Nganasan a resultative inflection occurs (2).

>'The train is about to leave'

>'I'm just flying to Dudinka'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a grammatical device (either inflectional or periphrastic) that can be used to express an action that is about to happen (regardless of other possible functions the device may have). Instances of a lexical verb used in the past tense form to convey an activity that is about to happen (e.g. Estonian *Läksime!* go.PST.1PL ‘Off we go!’, cf. Russian *пошли*) were not considered.
