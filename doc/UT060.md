**Are there participles that can encode their subject by possessive suffixes?**

If the answer is Y note also down the participle(s) that can take possessive suffix.

In Finnish, the A participant always has to be mentioned in the relative clause in the case of the agentive participial (-ma), e.g.:

teke-mä-ni työ
do-AG.PTCP-POSS.1SG work
‘Work that I did.’
