**Are there participles that can encode their subject by possessive suffixes?**

It may be possible for a language to use possessive marking to encode the subject of the respective relative clause. For instance, in Finnish the subject is expressed with the agentive participial (*-ma*), as in (1). Such marking of the subject can be seen as an indication of non-finiteness of participles (Shagal 2018).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>***teke-mä-ni** työ*<br/>
>do-AG.PTCP-POSS.1SG work<br/>
>‘Work that I did.’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a possessive suffix encoding the subject can attach to a participle. In the case there are no possessive suffixes in a language or a possessive suffix occurs in some other position (e.g. on the head noun), the value is '0'.
