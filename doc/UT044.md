**Are there sentences without overt verbal arguments (e.g. weather verbs)?**

Certain predicate verbs might not require any verbal arguments such as subjects or objects but can form sentences alone. This is often a characteristic of verbs expressing meteorological conditions ('to rain', 'to be cold' etc.).

>Finnish<br/> 
>*Sataa*<br/> 
>rain.3SG<br/>
>'It is raining'

>South Saami<br/> 
>*Tjåetskeme*<br/> 
>cold_weather.NMLZ<br/> 
>‘It is cold’

The answer is '1' if in a language it is possible to name such verbs that do not need any arguments.
