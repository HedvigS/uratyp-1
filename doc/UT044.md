**Are there sentences without overt verbal arguments (e.g. weather verbs)?**

There may be verbs that do not require any verbal arguments (such as a subject or an object) but can form sentences on their own. This is often attested with verbs expressing environmental conditions ('to rain', 'to be cold' etc.):

>(1) Finnish<br/> 
>*Sataa*<br/> 
>rain.3SG<br/>
>'It is raining'

>(2) South Saami<br/> 
>*Tjåetskeme*<br/> 
>cold_weather.NMLZ<br/> 
>‘It is cold’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there are avalent verbs, i.e. verbs that do not need any arguments. The value is '0' if each clause needs a subject, including the so-called dummy subject or expletive subject (such as *it* in the translations above).
