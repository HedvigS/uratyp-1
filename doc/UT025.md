**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of desire or wish?**

Desiderative modality has to do with the expression of desire or wish on the part of the referent of the subject to bring about a given state of affairs. For example, Mari has a separate desiderative mood marked by *-ne* (1). (The term *optative* may also be used.)

>(1) Mari (Riese et al. 2017)<br/>
>*Мый луд-не-м*<br/>
>I read-DES-1SG<br/>
>‘I want to/intend to read'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated marker for the expression of desire or wish. Examples of a conditional mood used in a similar meaning were not considered to count as '1', as the conditional mood tends to give regard a situation as being possible only under certain conditions.
