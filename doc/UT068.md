**Are there preverbs?**

Preverbs are preverbal morphemes that appear in front of a verb and form a close semantic unit with it; they tend to show syntactic mobility. Morphemes that function as preverbs typically also function as adverbs or adpositions. Preverbs may be used for perfectivization, aktionsart-formation, lexical word formation. They may also be called *bounders*.
