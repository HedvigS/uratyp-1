**Are there preverbs?**

Preverbs are preverbal morphemes that appear in front of a verb and form a close semantic unit with it; they tend to show syntactic mobility. Usually the morphemes that function as preverbs can also function as adverbs or adpositions. Preverbs may be used for perfectivization, aktionsart-formation, lexical word formation. They can also be called *binders*.

The answer is '1' if a language contains such preverbal morphemes that form a close semantic unit with the verb but may also show syntactic mobility. To count as a prevereb the respective element should also be put into grammatical functions (e.g. perfectivization).
