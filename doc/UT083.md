**Is there a terminative case?**

The terminative case is typically used to express up to which point in space (1a) or time (1b) an action takes place. 

>(1) Hungarian<br/>
>a. *pályaudvar-**ig***<br/>
>railway_station-TERM>br/>
>‘until the railway station’<br/>

>b. *péntek-**ig***<br/>
>Friday-TERM<br/>
>’until Friday’<br/>

To compare, in Finnish there is no separate case but a directional case followed by an adposition has to be used (e.g. *kotiin asti* 'until home'). 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case to express a limit in space or time as in Hungarian. If this can be regarded as a secondary function of some other case or the respective meaning is conveyed by an adpositional construction, the value is '0'.
