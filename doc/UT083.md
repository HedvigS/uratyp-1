**Is there a terminative case?**

The terminative is used to express up to which point in space (1a) or time (1b) an action takes place. 

>(1) Hungarian<br/>
>*pályaudvar-**ig*** (railway_station-TERM) ‘until the railway station’<br/>
>*péntek-**ig***  (Friday-TERM) ’until Friday’

To compare, Finnish uses a directional case + an adposition (e.g. *kotiin asti* 'until home'). Thus, the answer for Finnish is '0'.

The answer is '1' if there is a case that marks terminative either in space or time.
