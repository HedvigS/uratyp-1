**Are there palatalized dentals?**

In some languages, palatalized dental consonants (e.g. /tʲ, lʲ, nʲ/) contrast with plain dental consonants (non-palatalized dentals) on the phonological level, e.g. the word's meaning depends on the palatalization or non-palatalization of dentals.

>Estonian<br/>
>hall´ [halʲː] ‘grey’ vs. hall [halː] ‘frost’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is phonological opposition between palatalized dentals (e.g. /tʲ, lʲ, nʲ/) and non-palatalized dentals in the core vocabulary.
