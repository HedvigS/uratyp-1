**Is there an impersonal passive construction?**

In the case of impersonal passive, no constituent is promoted to subject position; in addition to transitive verbs it is possible to also "passivize" intransitive verbs such as ‘to be’, ‘to live’ (see 1a and 1b). Example (1b) also illustrates the case, when an object retains its position.

>a. *Siin **ela-takse** hästi*<br/>
>here live-IPS.PRS well<br/>
>'People live well here’ (lit. ‘It is lived well here.’)

>b. ***Kuula-takse**  muusika-t*<br/>
>listen-IPS.PRS music-PRT<br/>
>‘The music is being listened’<br/>

The answer is '1' if no consituent is promoted to subject position; consider both transitive as well as intransitive verbs. Analytical constructions also count.
