**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of deontic possibility?** 

Deontic possibility has to do with permission (*You may leave the hospital after a week*) and ability (*The children can swim across the lake*). This question asks, whether there is an inflectional or derivational marker, which can be used to convey these meanings. In Hungarian, the derivational suffix *-het/-hat*, which also functions as a marker of epistemic posisbility, can be used to give permission (1).

>*bejö-het-sz*<br/> 
>in_come-POT-2SG<br/>
>‘you may come in’

The answer is '1' if there is a separate morphological marker used to express ability and/or grant permission.
