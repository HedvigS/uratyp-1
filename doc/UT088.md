**Is there a locative case that marks source?**

It is possible that there are separate cases to mark GOAL, LOCATION, and SOURCE. This question asks whether there is a separate case to mark SOURCE, which does not overlap with the marking of LOCATION.

The answer is '1', if there is at least one such local case that marks SOURCE. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case marking also has another locative function (to mark GOAL or LOCATION).
