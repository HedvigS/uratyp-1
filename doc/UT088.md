**Is there a locative case that marks source?**

A language may contain different local cases for encoding goal, location, and source (see also UT086 and UT087). This question asks whether there is a separate case to mark source, as in Finnish (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Tule-n talo-**sta***<br/>
>come-1SG house-ELA<br/>
>‘I come from (inside of) the house.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such local case that marks source. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case marking also has another locative function (it is used to mark goal or location).
