**Are verbs marked in a specific mood in counterfactual conditional clauses?**

Counterfactuality may be defined as “fictitious creation of a possible world which does not correspond to the actual world and therefore is “contrary to fact” (*I wish I had a car*)”. Counterfactuality may be expressed in connection with past, present, or future. In all cases, the antecedent is contrary-to-fact, false, or unlikely (e.g. the situation of John being here in *If John were to be here next week, the party would be fun* is presented as unlikely). This question investigates verbs in counterfactual conditional clauses are marked in a specific mood (terms *conditional*, *irrealis* may be used). (VIIDE!) Finnish (1) and Nganasan (2) both show conditional marking:   

>(1)Finnish<br/>
>*Jos  ol-isi-t leipo-nut kaku-n, sö-isi-n se-n*<br/>
>if be-COND-2SG bake-ACT.PST.PTCP  cake-GEN eat-COND-1SG it-GEN<br/>
>’If you had baked a cake, I would eat it.’

>(2) Nganasan (Wagner-Nagy 2018)<br/>
>*mɨŋ ŋəmə-Ɂkə-suə i-hü-nüɁ ńaagəi-Ɂ kuntu-baaðəi-ńüɁ*<br/> 
>we eat-RES-PST.[3SG] be-COND-OBL.1PLPOSS good-ADV sleep-IRR.RFL-1PL.RFL<br/>
>‘If we had eaten, we would have slept well.’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if verbs are marked in a specific mood in counterfactual conditional clauses, i.e. in the protasis part of the sentence (typically contains the particle 'if').
