**Is there diminutive (hypocoristic) marking on verbs?**

Hypocoristic (also referred to as diminutive) forms are used to indicate attitudinal information about the affection of the speaker toward the referent. The aim of this question is to find out whether diminutive marking can be used on the verb. The respective reading may also referred to as *attenuative*. Usually, the diminutive marking on the verb gives the reading 'a little bit, for a while' (cf. Russia *po-*).

The answer is '1' if there is a diminutive marker on the verb that expresses affection.
