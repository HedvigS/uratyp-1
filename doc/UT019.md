**Is it common to use a verb in the present tense for future time reference?** 

Future time reference (FTR) may be expressed in several ways. One of the options is to use the present tense form of the lexical verb and deduce the future meaning from the context. For example, a temporal adverb (such as 'tomorrow', 'next year') may give rise to a future reading, also aspectual relations may play a role. Usage of the present tense for FTR is common, for instance, in Hungarian:

>(1) Hungarian (Rounds 2013: 50)<br/>
>*Jövő tél-en vesz-ek egy új autó-t*<br/>
>next winter-SUPESS buy-PRS.1SG a new car-ACC<br/>
>‘Next winter I will buy a new car’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if FTR is commonly expressed by means of the present tense. If a language has a dedicated future marker (an inflection, auxiliary or derivation), the answer is usually '0'.
