**Can modifiers of action nominalization in agent and patient roles both be marked like possessors?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether modifiers of action nominalization can be marked like possessors in agent and patient roles. Estonian example in (1a) has two interpretations: the genitive-marked *poisi* can be understood as the agent or the patient (depending on the context). The genitive is also used for possessors (cf. 1b).  

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>***poisi** pese-mine*<br/>
>boy.GEN washing<br/>
>'washing of the boy (i.e. done by the boy)'/ 'washing the boy'

>b. ***poisi** tuba*<br/>
>boy:GEN room<br/>
>â€˜boy's room'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if possessors are marked the same way as modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles. The value is '1' also in the case of zero marking.
