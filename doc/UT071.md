**Can modifiers of action nominalization in agent and patient roles both be marked like possessors?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether modifiers of action nominalization can be marked like possessors in agent and patient roles. Estonian example in (1) has two interpretations: the genitive-marked *poisi* can be understood express agent as well as the patient (depending on the context). The genitive case is also used for possessors (cf. 2).  

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>***poisi** pesemine*<br/>
>boy:GEN washing<br/>
>'washing of the boy’/ 'washing the boy'

>b. ***poisi** tuba*<br/>
>boy:GEN room<br/>
>‘boy's room'

The answer is '1' if the same case marking can be used for the possessors as well as modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles.
