**Is there differential subject marking?**

In addition to differential object marking (see UT010-UT012), languages may also show differential subject marking (DSM). In a broad sense, already a different case of a subject, or a different agreement or position of a subject counts as DSM; in a narrower sense, such differences ought to depend on the features of the subject in some way or other to be regarded as DSM (Woolford 2009:17). In Estonian, the nominative case may be used for identification or conveying a definite amount of something (1a), whereas the partitive case may be used to express an indefinite amount of something (1b).

>a. *Laua-l on leib*<br/>
>table-ADE be.3SG bread.NOM<br/>
>‘There is the bread on the table’

>b. *Laua-l on leiba*<br/>
>table-ADE  be.3SG bread.PRT<br/>
>‘There is some bread on the table’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if subject marking varies under certain conditions. When answering the question, only finite clauses were considered.
