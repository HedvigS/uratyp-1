**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express indirect commands/wishes etc. directed to the 3Sg?**

A command addressed to a singular 2nd person can be regarded as a canonical imperative, but commands can also be addressed to other persons (Aikhenvald 2015: 234). The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to mark an indirect command addressed to a singular 3rd person using a specific mood, as in (1) and (2). (The respective forms are usually called *jussive*, *optative* or *imperative*.)

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän  tul-**koon** sisään*<br/>
>s/he  come-JUSS.3SG inside<br/>
>‘Let him/her come inside!’

>(2) Nganasan (Wagner-Nagy 2018)<br/>
>*sɨti baðǝ-tǝ-ndi buǝ-**ŋǝǝ-ցǝj***<br/>
>they.DU essence-LAT-OBL.3SGPOSS speak-IMP-3DU<br/>
>'Let they both speak.'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a specific marking different from the indicative appears on the verb to convey an indirect command to the 3Sg.
