**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express indirect commands/wishes etc. directed to the 3Sg?**

A command addressed to a singular 2nd person can be regarded as a canonical imperative. In some languages, it is possible to address commands also to other persons. (Aikhenvald 2015: 234) The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to mark an indirect command addressed to a singular 3rd person using a specific mood, as in examples (1) and (2). The respective forms may be called various ways, e.g. *jussive*, *optative* or *imperative*.

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*hän  **tul-koon** sisään*<br/>
>s/he  come-JUSS.3SG inside<br/>
>‘Let him/her come inside!’

>(2) Nganasan (Wagner-Nagy 2018)<br/>
>*sɨti baðǝ-tǝ-ndi **buǝ-ŋǝǝ-ցǝj***<br/>
>they.DU essence-LAT-OBL.3SGPOSS speak-IMP-3DU<br/>
>'Let they both speak.'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a specific marking different from the indicative appears on the verb to convey an indirect command to the 3Sg.
