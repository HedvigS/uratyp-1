**Can the modifier of action nominalization in patient role (e.g. "drinking of coffee") be marked like the direct object?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether it is possible to use the same marking for the modifier of action nominalization in the patient role and for the direct object. In Estonian, the genitive case has such functions (see 1a and 1b).

>a. ***luuletuse** kirjutamine*<br/>

>b. *kirjuta-n **luuletuse***<br/> 
>write-1SG poem:GEN

The answer is '1' if the same object case can be used in both occasions (as in Estonian).
