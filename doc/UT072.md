**Can the modifier of action nominalization in patient role (e.g. "drinking of coffee") be encoded like the direct object?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether it is possible to use the same marking for the modifier of action nominalization in the patient role and for the direct object. In Estonian, the genitive case appears in both occasions (cf. 1a and 1b). 

>(1) Estonian<br/> 
>a. ***luuletuse** kirjutamine*<br/> 
>poem.GEN writing<br/>
>'a poem writing'

>b. *kirjuta-n **luuletuse***<br/> 
>write-1SG poem.GEN
>'I'll write a poem'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if one and the same case can be used in both occasions (as in Estonian).
