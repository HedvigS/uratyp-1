**Does the numeral modification of a noun have an effect on its case selection?** 

Both cardinal as well as ordinal numerals can modify a noun phrase. Whereas cardinal numerals express the number of referents denoted by the noun (*three books*), ordinal numerals convey their order in comparison with the other referents (*the third book*). They may also differ in their underlying (morpho)syntax. (Dryer 2007: 164) This question concerns the usage of cardinal numerals and the possible consequences of their use on the noun they modify. For example, while the numeral 1 requires the nominative case in Finnish, the cardinal numerals bigger than 1 take the partitive:

>Finnish<br/>
>*yksi ystävä :  kaksi ystävää*<br/> 
>one.NOM.SG friend.NOM.SG :  two.NOM.SG  friend.PRT.SG<br/>
>‘one friend' : 'two friends’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if a cardinal numeral can influence the case selection of a noun; if not, the answer is '0'.
