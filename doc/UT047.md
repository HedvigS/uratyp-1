**Can locative adverbial phrases act as predicates without a copula?**

Locative adverb is an adverb that refers to some kind of location. Locative adverbial phrases are noun (or prepositional) phrases or sentences with locational marking. The aim of this question is to find out whether locative adverbial phrases can occur without the copula. This is possible in South Saami (1), whereas in Finnish usage of the 'be'-verb is requiered (2). 

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Manne ålkone*<br/>
>I out<br/>
>'I am outside’

>(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Minä ole-n ulkona*<br/>
>I be-1SG out<br/>
>‘I am outside.’

The answer is '1' if the locative adverbial phrase can occur without an existential verb as in example (1).
