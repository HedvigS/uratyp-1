**Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?**

Dual is a grammatical number category that refers to two entities. A noun or pronoun used in the dual form may also require dual agreement in verbs. Agreement may involve various kinds of nouns (e.g. animate and inanimate nouns) as well as pronouns. In South Saami, we only find dual agreement with pronouns:

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Månnoeh luhkien*<br/>
>we.1DU read.1DU<br/>
>‘We two read'

In other instances, the plural form is used:<br/>
>(2) South Saami<br/>
>*Maanah låhkijägan*<br/>
>child.PL read.3DU<br/>
>‘Two children read’

>(3) South Saami<br/>
>*Göökte  gaahtoeh  byöpmedieh*<br/> 
>two      cat.PL    eat.3PL<br/>
>‘Two cats eat'

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is verbal agreement with dual subject in at least one of the possibilities mentioned above. The answer is ‘0’ if dual is marked only on the verb.</p>
