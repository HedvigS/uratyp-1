**Is the order of number and case suffixes fixed across the paradigm the same?**

This question examines whether the order of number and case suffixes is fixed or is there variation (cf. UT110). In Komi-Zyrian, for instance, the number suffix precedes the case suffix: 

>*зонъяслы*<br/> 
>*zon-**jɑs-lɨ***<br/>
>boy-PL-DAT<br/>
>'to the boys'<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is no variation in the ordering of the number and the case suffix, i.e. one of them precedes the other in all contexts. The answer is '0' if there is variation, i.e. their order is not the same in all contexts.
