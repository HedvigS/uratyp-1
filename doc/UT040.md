**Can second person singular verb forms be used in generic meaning?**

Canonical function of the 2nd person singular forms is to refer to the addressee but they may also receive generic interpretation when the 2Sg form is used without any specific 2nd person addressee is mind. There are instances that are unambiguously generic as otherwise the interpretation would literally be wrong. However, there are also sentences that can have several interpretations. (Gast et al. 2015: 148-149) For instance, Veps example (1) could be directed to the addressee, but as claimed by Grünthal (2015: 125) 2nd person singular forms are also used in the generic function in Veps. 

>(1) Veps (Grünthal 2015: 125)<br/>
>*Olude-spai  humalstu-**d***<br/>
>beer-ELA get_drunk-2SG<br/>
>'One gets drunk from beer’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if 2nd person singular forms can have in generic meaning in the language.
