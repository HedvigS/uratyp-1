**Are there nonfinite forms that can relativize at least all core participants (S/A/P) and possibly also some noncore participants, e.g. locative adverbials, instruments, etc.?**

There are participles that can relativize only one specific participant of the situation (i.e. only S/A, P or S/P) but there are also participles that can relativize all core participants  as well as some noncore participants. This question asks whether there are such participles in a language that can be used in a wide variety of contexts.
In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs.

Hill Mari -šašlə̑k does not relativize any particular constituent but can be used in a wide variety of contexts including the relativization of locatives (Shagal 2018).
