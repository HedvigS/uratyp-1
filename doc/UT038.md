**Can an impersonal (or passive) form be used instead of a finite plural form with an overt subject expression?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to use an impersonal form (may be called *passive*) in the finite paradigm instead of a finite form. In Veps (1), the impersonal form appears in the 3rd person plural, whereas in Finnish in the 1st person plural (2). Both examples combine with as overt subject and are instances of active voice. 

>(1) Veps<br/>
>*priha-d to-**das***<br/>
>boy-PL bring-IPS.PRS<br/>
>‘The boys bring (sth)’

>Finnish (spoken language)<br/>
>*me oste-**taan***<br/> 
>we   buy-IPS.PRS<br/> 
>'we buy'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if using an impersonal (passive) form is possible at least in one of the plural forms (i.e. 1PL, 2PL and/or 3PL). Only instances of impersonal (passive) form used with an overtly expressed subject/agent (as in Veps and Finnish) to express active voice were counted as '1'.
