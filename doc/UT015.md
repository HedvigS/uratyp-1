**Can S and P be conflated morphologically across clause boundaries, i.e. act as syntactic pivot?**

Apart from languages where S and A can be conflated across clause boundaries (see UT014) there are also languages that combine S (= subject in the intransitive sentence) and P (= object in the transitive sentence), which implies an 'ergative' pivot (see Aikhenvald 2015: 258).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if S and P are combined in pivot functions. This would mean that in examples such as (1) the woman (not the thief) ran away. As in Estonian S=A (see UT014), the answer for Estonian is '0'.
