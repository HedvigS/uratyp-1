**Are there nonfinite forms specialized on the relativization of particular core participants, e.g. subjects (S/A), direct objects (P), absolutive participants (S/P)?**

Participles are known for the capacity to relativize constituents of the situation described in the clause; such participants include S (the single participant of an intransitive clause; intransitive subject), A (the agentive participant of a transitive clause; transitive subject), P (the patientive participant of a transitive clause; direct object) and various oblique participants (locatives, instrumentals, etc.). Some participles can relativize only one specific participant of the situation (i.e. only S/A, P or S/P) and thus are inherently oriented toward that specific participant. This question asks whether there are such participles in a language. This is true for Finnish as active participles are A/S-oriented, i.e. they relativize subjects (1a), whereas passive participles are P-oriented, i.e. they relativize objects (1b). There is no one participle that could do both (*luettu* cannot be used for 1a, nor can *lukeva* be used for 1b).

>a. ***lukeva** poika* (< *poika, joka lukee* 'a boy who is reading'; *poika* 'boy' = A; thus, the active present participle relativizes subjects)<br/>
>b. ***luettu** kirja* (< *lukeaa kirjaa* 'to read a book'; *kirja* 'book' = P; thus, the passive past participle relativizes P-arguments)

The answer is '1' if there is at least one such nonfinite form, which is specialized on the relativization of one of these arguments. If one participle can do all (i.e. relativize S/A, P, S/P), the answer is '1'. 

(In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs.)
