**Is there a constraint on word-initial r [r]?**

There can be constraint on word-initial r [r], e.g. in Udmurt the word-initial r is not allowed for phonotactic reasons, but replaced with a voiced affricate.

>Udmurt<br/>
>ӟуч [d͡ʑut͡ɕ] ‘Russian’ 

To compare, in Komi, which is a close cognate language, word-initial r is allowed: роч [rot͡ɕ] ‘Russian’.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a constraint on word-initial r [r].
