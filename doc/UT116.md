**Is there contrastive length of consonants?**

If there is a phonological opposition of single consonants and geminate consonants in a language, the length of consonant changes the word meaning, as in Finnish and Estonian. 

>Finnish<br/>
>kuka [ˈku.kaˑ] ‘who’ vs. kukka [ˈkuk.ka] ‘flower’<br/>

>Estonian<br/>
>varas [ˈva.ras] 'thief' vs. varras [ˈvar.ras] 'rod; stick'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the meaning of the word depends on the length of the consonant.
