**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of apprehension?**

The apprehensive marker is typically used to express fear or regret about a certain situation; often the state of affairs is viewed as something undesirable. In Tundra Nenets, the apprehensive mood is used to convey fear about the future and regret about the past; usually it is accompanied by the negative form (Nikolaeva 2014:90-91).
