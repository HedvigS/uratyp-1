**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of apprehension?**

The apprehensive marker is used to express fear or regret about a certain situation; the state of affairs may be viewed as something undesirable. In Tundra Nenets, the apprehensive mood is used to convey fear about the future and regret about the past; usually it is accompanied by a negative form (Nikolaeva 2014: 90-91).
