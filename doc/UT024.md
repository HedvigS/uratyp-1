**Is there grammatical marking of mirativity?**

Mirativity is a grammatical category used to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Although mirativity may be viewed as a subcategory of evidentiality (inferentiality) as it often arises as an extension of evidentiality, there are reasons to view it in its own right: (i) unexpected situation is not necessarily inferred; (ii) it may also emerge as an extension of tense or mood (OUDB). In Northern Mansi, mirativity is regarded as a separate category; it is shown to have evolved through desubordination (Skribnik 2005). In Khanty dialects, the category of evidentiality and mirativity reveal different origins (Nikolaeva 1999).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate marker to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Both synthetic as well as analytic means count, if they have a dedicated use.
