**Is there grammatical marking of mirativity?**

Mirativity is a grammatical category used to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Although mirativity is sometimes viewed as a subcategory of evidentiality (inferentiality) as it often arises as an extension of evidentiality, there are reasons to view it in its own right: (i) unexpected situation is not necessarily inferred; (ii) it may also emerge as an extension of tense or mood (see OUD).
For instance, in Northern Mansi mirativity is seen as a separate category. It is said to have evolved through desubordination (Skribnik 2005). In Khanty dialects, the category of evidentiality and mirativity reveal different origins (Nikolaeva 1999).

The answer is '1' if there is a separate marker to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Both synthetic as well as analytic means count, if they have a dedicated used.
