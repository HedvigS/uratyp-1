**Is there animacy distinction in independent interrogative pronouns?**

Animacy distinction in independent interrogative pronouns means that a language distinguishes between 'who' and 'what'. For example, in Mansi, *xoonxa*/*xotjut* means 'who' and is used for humans, whereas *manõr* means 'what' and is used for animals and inanimate objects (Riese 2001).

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is a distinction between 'who' and 'what'. If there is no such distinction, the answer is '0'.
