**Is there a separate case for marking the means by which something is carried out (instrumental) and/or accompaniement (comitative)?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether there is a case that primarily expresses instrumental or comitative function. In Estonian there such a case can be used in both functions (1). In Finnish there is a specialized xase marker that only combines with the plural root (2).

>(1) Estonian<br/> 
>*lusika-ga* ‘with a spoon’ (instrumental function), *lapse-ga* ‘with a child’ (comitative function)

>(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän kirjoitti kyn-i-**ne**-en*<br/>
>s/he write.PST.3SG  pen-PL-COM-POSS.3<br/>
>‘He wrote with a pen.’ (instrumental function)

The answer is '1' if there is a case marker that has at least one of the above mentioned functions as the primary function. The answer is '0' if the comitative and/or instrumental meaning is a secondary meaning of some other case.
