**Are there special negative non-finite forms? (Shagal & Miestamo)**

Special negative non-finite forms are forms that can be considered as inherently negative. In such cases, the affixes cannot be analysed in a straightforward way as the respective affirmative marker + a negative marker. For instance, in Northern Khanty, there are two affirmative participles, the non-past participle in *-ti* and past participle in *-m*, and they are both negated by the form in *-li* (1).

The Finnish negative participle in *-maton* is diachronically *-ma* + nominal negator *-ton* (cf. *asunto* ‘apartment’ + *-ton = asunnoton* ‘the one without an apartment’), but it has too many idiosyncratic features, e.g. it can negate all of the participles, and not just the agentive one in *-ma* (cf. *koskaan kuolematon rakkaus* ‘the love that never dies’). Therefore, it can be regarded as a special non-finite form.
