**Can 3Sg possessive suffix be used to mark definiteness?** 

Possessive suffixes may be found in a non-possessive function, such as the expression of definiteness (see also UT104). This question asks whether 3Sg possessive suffixes can be used to convey definiteness. For example, in Nganasan, the 3Sg possessive suffix can mark definiteness of celestial bodies and natural phenomena if the entity is a planet or it is topicalized (Wagner-Nagy 2019: 174). 

>Nganasan (Wagner-Nagy 2019: 174)<br/>
>*kou-**ðu** ŋǝðu-tɨ, ŋǝtu-m-hi͡atɨ*<br/>
>sun-3SGPOSS be.visible-AOR.3SG be.visible-TRL-INFER.3SG<br/>
>‘The sun is visible, it becomes visible’<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if the 3Sg possessive suffix can be used to mark definiteness. The answer is '0' if the 3Sg possessive suffix does not have such a function or if possessive suffixes are not present in a language.
