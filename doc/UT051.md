**Can non-finite dependent clauses use the standard negation construction?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether the standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses. For instance in Hungarian, the negative marker *nem* can be used in both contexts (see 1a and 1b). 

>(1) Hungarian<br/>
>a. *Nem lát-va a kutyá-t, megbotl-ott*<br/>
>NEG see-PTCP DEF dog-ACC trip.over-PST.3SG<br/> 
>'As he did not see the dog, he tripped over'<br/>
>b. *Nem lát-ta meg a kutyá-t és megbotl-ott*<br/>
>NEG see-PST.3SG PRV DEF dog and trip.over-PST.3SG<br/>
>'He did not see the dog and tripped over'<br/>

To compare, in Estonian the particle *ei* that is used to express standard negation is not compatible with non-finite clauses and *mitte* has to be used instead (2). 

>(2) Estonian<br/>
>*Küsimuse-st **mitte** aru saa-des ta ei vasta-nud*<br/>
>question-ELA not understand-CVB s/he NEG answer-ACT.PST.PTCP<br/>
>'Having not understood the question, s/he did not answer'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses (as in Hungarian). The answer is '0' dependent non-finite clauses make use of a different negative marker (as in Estonian) or an entirely different negation construction is used.
