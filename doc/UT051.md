**Can non-finite dependent clauses use the standard negation construction? (Shagal & Miestamo)**

The aim of this question is to find out whether the standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses.
For instance in Hungarian, the regular negative particle *nem* can be used in both contexts (1). 

(1)

To compare, in Estonian the standard negation marker *ei* is not compatible with non-finite clauses and *mitte* has to be used instead (2).

The answer is '1' if standard negation construction can also be used for non-finite dependent clauses (as in example 1). The answer is '0' if some other negation marker has to be used in dependent non-finite clauses (as in example 2) or an entirely different construction needs to be used.
