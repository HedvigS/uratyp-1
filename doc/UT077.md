**Is case compounding possible?**

Case compounding is usually understood as attachment of multiple case markers to a noun stem that make up a phonological word. A type of case compounding is case-stacking, when  independently occurring case affixes are used to describe a complex trajectory, typically expressing combination of the meanings of the two affixes.

The answer is '1' if at least two case markers can be attached to the noun. The prerequisite is that the examples contain proper case endings, e.g. Veps examples such as *mužika-nno-päi* ‘from the side of the man’ do not count as *-päi* is not an independent case ending.
