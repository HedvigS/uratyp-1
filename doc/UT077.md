**Is case compounding possible?**

Case compounding is usually understood as attachment of multiple case markers to a noun stem that make up a phonological word. A type of case compounding is case-stacking, when  independently occurring case affixes are used to describe a complex trajectory, typically expressing combination of the meanings of the two affixe, as in (1). 

>(1) Udmurt (Arkhangelskij, Usacheva 2019)<br/>
>*gurt-len-ez-len*<br/>
>village-GEN-POSS.3SG-GEN<br/>
>‘of the one that belongs to the village’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if at least two case markers can be attached to the noun. The prerequisite is that the examples contain proper case endings.
