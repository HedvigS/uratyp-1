**Is there a separate case for marking accompaniment, which is different from the instrumental?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether accompaniment and the instrumental function can be expressed by different means. This question specifically asks for the comitative function conveying ‘together with’. In Komi, the accompaniment can be expressed with a marker different from the instrumental marker (cf. 1 and 2).

>(1) Komi Zyrian<br/>
>*мамыдкöд mɑm-ɨd-**kɘd***<br/> 
>mother-POSS.2SG-COM<br/>
>'with your mother’(comitative)

>(2) Komi Zyrian<br/>
>*паньöн pɑɲ-ɘn*<br/> 
>spoon-INS<br/> 
>‘with a spoon’(instrumental)

The answer is '1' if there is a separate case to express accompaniment. To get the value '1' the language also has to contain a separate instrumental case.
