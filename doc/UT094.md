**Is there a separate case for marking accompaniment, which is different from the instrumental?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether there are different means to express accompaniment ("in the company of") and the instrumental function ("using, by means of"). To exemplify, in Komi-Zyrian, there is a comitative case (1a) and instrumental case (1b).

>(1) Komi-Zyrian<br/>
>a. *мамыдкöд* (comitative)<br/>
>*mɑm-ɨd-**kɘd***<br/> 
>mother-POSS.2SG-COM<br/>
>'with your mother’(comitative)

>b. *паньöн* (instrumental)<br/>
>*pɑɲ-**ɘn***<br/> 
>spoon-INS<br/> 
>‘with a spoon’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case marker denoting accompaniment. In order to be coded as '1' the language also has to contain a separate instrumental case.
