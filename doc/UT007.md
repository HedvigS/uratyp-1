**Can adpositions be used to mark non-core/oblique verbal arguments?**

The non-core/oblique verbal arguments are arguements that have a function other than that of S, A or P, e.g. they may encode the dative, locative, ablative, instrumental, comitative or some other function. This question asks whether adpositions can be used to mark such arguments. In Estonian, both the ablative case as well as postpositional phrase can be used to encode source:

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>*Ta küsi-s **ema-lt / ema käest** raha*<br/> 
>s/he ask-PST.3SG mother.ABL / mother.GEN from money.PRT<br/>
>‘S/he asked money from mother’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if it is possible to use adpositions to mark non-core/oblique verbal arguments (i.e. arguments other than S, A, P).
