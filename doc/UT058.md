**Is there a specialized negative participial form, which cannot be analyzed as a specific participial marker + negation marker?**

The aim of this questions is to find out whether a language contains specialized negative participles, 
which cannot be analyzed as a comboination of a specific participial marker and a negation marker.  

Northern Khanty (Ugric, Russia, Nikolaeva 1999: 34)
[pe:jal-ti  xo:s-li] ńa:wre:m il su:wil-ǝ-ti  pit-ǝ-s
swim-INF can-PTCP.NEG child down drown-EP-INF start-EP-PST.3SG
‘A child who could not swim started drowning.’

Do not consider instances where participial clauses are negated simply with negative markers, e.g.: 

Erzya 
[a / avol’ lovn-ic’a] t’ejt’er’
NEG / NEG read-PTCP.PRS girl
‘a girl who does not read’
