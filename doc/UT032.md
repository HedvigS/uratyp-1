**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express indirect commands/wishes etc. directed to the 1Sg?**

In addition to commands addressed to a singular 2nd person it is also possible to direct commands to other persons (see also UT031). This question investigates whether there is specific morphological marking on the verb expressing a command adressed to a singular 1st person, as in example (1). The respective forms may be referred in various ways, e.g. *jussive*, *optative*, *imperative*, *hortative*.

>3SG suggest-PST.3SG that 1SG go-JUSS in_front<br/>
>‘S/he suggested that I should go ahead’ 

**Codig.** The value is '1' if specific marking is used on the verb to direct a command to the 1Sg. In other cases the value is '0' (e.g. if a particle is used but the verb remains in the indicative form).
