**Can verbs in purposive subordinate clauses be in bare infinitive form?**

The purposive clauses are used to express ‘in order to’, ‘so that’ etc. The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to use an infinitive form in the corresponding subordinate clause. The clause may also be called *final clause*.
