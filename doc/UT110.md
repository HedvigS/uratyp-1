**Is the order of possessive suffix and case suffix across the paradigm the same?**

It is common for affixes to occur in a fixed order, but it is by no means universal. Still, multiple orders do not necessarily have consequences for meaning (Lieber & Štekauer 2014: 376). The possessive suffix and the case suffix may be ordered in one way or the other, cf.  Hungarian *kutya-m-nak* (px + case) vs. Finnish *koira-lle-ni* (case + px) ‘to my dog'. However, in both languages their order is fixed meaning that in Hungarian the possessive suffix always precedes the case suffix and in Finnish it always follows the case suffix. To compare, in Udmurt, there is variation in the ordering of the two suffixes depending on the case, e.g. with terminative and dative the possessive suffix comes before the case suffix, whereas in the illative and prolative it follows the case suffix (Kel’makov 2008: 77).

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is no variation in the ordering of the possessive suffix and the case suffix, i.e. one of them precedes the other in all contexts (as in Hungarian adn Finnish). The answer is '0' if their order is not the same in all context but it is dependent something (as in Udmurt).
