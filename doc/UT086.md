**Is there a locative case that marks goal?**

It is possible that there are separate cass to mark GOAL, LOCATION, and SOURCE. This question asks is there a separate case to mark the GOAL, which does not overlap with the marking of LOCATION and/or SOURCE.

The answer is '1', if there is at least one such local case that marks GOAL. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case marking also has another locative function (usually to mark LOCATION).
