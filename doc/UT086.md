**Is there a locative case that marks goal?**

A language may contain different local cases for encoding goal, location, and source (see also UT087 and UT088). This question asks whether there is a separate case to mark goal (1).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such local case that marks goal (in some languages there may be more than one local cases to express goal). The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, e.g. the case used to mark goal is also used to mark location or source.
