**Is it common to use the imperative/jussive in complement clauses introduced by predicates expressing wish/desire/will?** 

Complement clauses introduced by verbs of different semantic types (e.g. 'want', 'order', 'see' etc.) may also require different marking on the verb in the complement clause. The aim of this question is to find outh whether imperative/jussive marking is possible in complement clauses introduced by verbs conveying 'wish', 'want', or related meanings, as in Hungarian example containing 'want' (1). (A different term may be used instead of imperative/jussive; e.g. in Hungarian the term subjunctive or conjunctive is preferred.)

>*Nem akar-ja, hogy kijöjjünk a víz-ből*<br/>
>NEG want-3SG.DEF that out_come.SUBJ.1PL.INDEF DEF.ART water-ELA<br/> 
>'S/he doesen't want us to come out from the water.'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if imperative/jussive marking can appear in the complement clause introduced by predicates expressing wis/desire/will.
