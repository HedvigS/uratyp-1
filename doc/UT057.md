**Are there nonfinite forms that can relativize at least some noncore participants, e.g. locative adverbials or instruments, but cannot relativize all or some of the core participants, e.g. subjects?**

It is also possible for a language to have a participle, which cannot relativize all core participants, but can relativize at least some noncore participants. 
In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs.

E.g. in Beserman Udmurt there is a participle ending in -n, which cannot relativize subjects. But it can be used for direct object and instrumental relativization.
