**Can the same coordinating conjunction be used for NPs, VPs, and clauses?** 

The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to use the same coordinating conjunction (i.e. 'and'-coordination) for NPs, VPs, and clauses. For instance in Hungarian the nominal and verbal conjunctive coordination do not differ:

>*Anna **és** Péter* ‘Anna and Peter’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** tanul* ‘Peter reads and studies’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** Anna tanul* ‘Peter reads and Anna studies'

The answer is '1' if it is possible to use the same coordinating conjunction for NPs, VPs, and clauses. The answer is '0', if this is not possible. The answer is '0' even if in one of the cases juxtaposition is used (i.e. no conjunction marker is needed).
