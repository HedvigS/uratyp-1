**Can the same coordinating conjunction be used for NPs, VPs, and clauses?** 

Coordination is used to mean uniting syntactic constructions of the same type into larger units. This may be done by simply placing two units next to each other, another stategy is to use a linker or a coordinator (Velupillai 202: 318). This question asks whether it is possible to use the same coordinator for conjunctive coordination (i.e. 'and'-coordination) for NPs, VPs, and clauses, as in the Hungarian example.

>Hungarian
>*Anna **és** Péter* ‘Anna and Peter’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** tanul* ‘Peter reads and studies’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** Anna tanul* ‘Peter reads and Anna studies'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the same coordinating conjunction can be used for NPs, VPs, and clauses. The answer is '0' if a different stategy (e.g juxtaposition - no conjunction) is used already in one of the cases.
