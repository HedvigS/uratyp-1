**Is the singular form of the noun also used with numerals bigger than 1?**

It is common for the word meaning ‘1’ to assign singular number to its sister noun, whereas with words expressing higher values plural number (or dual) can be expected (cross-lingistically this applies at least to numbers up to '10') (Hurford 2003: 582). However, there are also languages that can assign singular number to all its sister nouns. This is true, for instance, to Komi-Zyrian, e.g.:

>Komi-Zyrian<br/>
>*öти **небöг** : куим **небöг***<br/>
>*ɘci ɲebɘg : kuim ɲebɘg*<br/>
>one.NOM.SG book.NOM.SG : three.NOM.SG book.NOM.SG<br/>
>'one book' : 'three books'

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if the noun can appear in the singular form also with numerals bigger than 1 (as in Komi-Zyrian example above). This also concerns languages where the numeral 2 is marked for dual but in other cases the singular marking is used. The answer is '0' if singular marking is not commonly used with numerals bigger than 1.
