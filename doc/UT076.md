**Are there separate adpositions to express goal, source, and location (without there being syncretism)?**

Adpositions may express a distinction between goal (also called *destination of movement*), location, and source of movement (for case marking, see also UT090 and UT091). As conflation in systems of spatial adpositions is relatively common (especially of location and destination marking; see e.g. Creissels 2012), this question only targets instances that reveal a tripartite system without there being syncretism, as in examples (1a-c):

(1) Finnish<br/>
>a. *Kävele-n tal-on **lähe-lle*** ’I walk near the house’<br/>
>walk-1SG house-GEN near-ALL<br/>
>b. *Ole-n   talo-n  **lähe-llä*** ‘I am near the house’<br/>
>be-1SG  house-GEN near-ADE<br/>
>*c. Tule-n   talo-n   **lähe-ltä*** ‘I come from near the house’<br/>
>come-1SG house-GEN near-ABL<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if such a three-way distinction as in (1a-c) is possible at least with some adpositions. If no tripartite system can be attested, the answer is '0'.
