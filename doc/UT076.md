**Are there separate adpositions to express goal, source, and location (without there being syncretism)?**

Similarly to cases (see also UT091 and UT092) adpositions may express a distinction between goal (also called destination of movement), source of movement, and location. As conflation in systems of spatial adpositions is relatively common (especially of location and destination marking; see e.g. Creissels 2012), this question only considers instances that reveal a tripartite system without there being syncretism, as in examples (a-c):

>Finnish<br/>
>a. *Kävele-n talon **lähe-lle*** ’I walk near the house’<br/>
>walk-1SG house.GEN near-ALL<br/>
>b. *Ole-n   talon  **lähe-llä*** ‘I am near the house’<br/>
>be-1SG  house.GEN near-ADE<br/>
>*c. Tule-n   talon   **lähe-ltä*** ‘I come from near the house’<br/>
>come-1SG house.GEN near-ABL<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if such three-way distinction as in (a-c) is possible at least with some adpositions. If no tripartite system can be attested, the answer is '0'.
