**Can tense be expressed overtly on the negative marker?**

Language that contain a negative marker which takes inflectional morphology (usually called *negative auxiliary*) differ with respect to grammatical categories expressed on the negative auxiliary vs. lexical verb. The aim of this question is to find out whether tense can be expressed on the negative auxiliary, as in South Saami (1b). Cf. also UT022.

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>a. *Im lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I do not read’

>b. *Idtjim lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.PST.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I did not read’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if tense can be expressed overtly on the negative marker (negative auxiliary).
