**Is there a special negator that combines with non-finite forms? (Shagal & Miestamo)**

It is possible for a language to have a particle, a suffix or some other negative marker that only appears with non-finite forms, i.e. it cannot negate finite verbs. For example in Beserman Udmurt, the present participle in *-š’* and the non-past participle in *-no* are negated by a regular adjectival negative marker *-tem* (“a derivative suffix with caritive meaning” according to Edygarova 2015: 278), while the past participle in *-m* is negated with the specialized participial negative marker *‑te*. Both of these markers count as special non-finite negators. In Estonian, there is the special negator *mitte* that only negates non-finite forms a(the standard negation marker *ei* cannot be used).

The answer is '1' if there is a special form that is compatible with non-finite forms. Markers of non-finite forms that are inherently negative (i.e. cannot be analysed as a combination of two separate markers) were not considered.
