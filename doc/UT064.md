**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and agentive nominalizations?**

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions without any additional morphology. One of the options is to use a nonfinite form as a participle and as an agentive nominalizations, see Livonian examples (1a) and (1b).

The answer is '1' if a nonfinite form can be used both as a participle and as an agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
