**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and agentive nominalizations?**

In addition to the possibility to use one and the same nonfinite form as a participle and action nominalization (see UT063), there may also be overlap between the form functioning as a participle and as agentive nominalization. Respective examples can be found, for instance, in Livonian (cf. 1a and 1b).

(1) Livonian<br/>
>a. *a'ili-**ji***<br/>
>run-AG.NMLZ<br/> 
>'a runner'<br/>

>b. *a'ili-**ji** i'bbi*<br/> 
>run-AG.NMLZ horse.NOM<br/> 
>‘a running horse’ (lit. ‘a runner horse’)<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a nonfinite form can be used both as a participle and as an agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
