**Are there syntactically ditransitive verbs?**

Canonical ditransitive verbs are verbs of transfer, such as 'give', 'sell', and 'lend'. Each verb takes an agent (e.g. the giver), a theme (e.g. the thing given), and recipient-like argument (e.g. the reciever). (see Comrie et al. 2010; Harley & Miyagawa 2017) A verb is here considered to be syntactically ditransitive if the two internal arguments (agent is an external argument) can be both encoded like objects, as in English example (1a). Cf. example (1b), where the receiver is marked by a prepositional construction.

>(1) English<br/>
>a. *Mary give John a book* (double object construction)<br/>
>b. *Mary give a book to John* (prepositional construction)<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there are ditransitive verbs that encode the theme as well as the recipient-like argument using an object case. The value is '0' if the recipient-like argument is encoded with a case not used to mark an object or a prepositional phrase is used.
