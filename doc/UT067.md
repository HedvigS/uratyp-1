**Is it possible to place an object between the negative marker and the main verb in imperative constructions?** 

The aim of this question is to find out whether  it is possible to place an object between the negative marker and the main verb in imperative constructions. This is possible in Estonian (1) but not in Udmurt (cf. 2).

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>*Ära **sõpru** unusta!*<br/>
>NEG.IMP friend.PL.PRT forget.CNG<br/> 
>‘Don’t forget friends.’

>(2) Udmurt<br/>
>*En das’a **s’ion**!*<br/>
>NEG  prepare.IMP:2SG  meal.NOM<br/>
>‘Don’t prepare a meal!’

The answer is '1' if it is possible to place an object between the negative marker and the main verb, even if this makes the sentence unneutral.
