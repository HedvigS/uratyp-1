**Can the possessor in the attributive construction be marked with the nominative?**

Attributive possession, which involves a possessor and possessee, can be expressed in various ways. There can be a marker on the possessor and/or on the possessee, or they can simply be juxtaposed. This question examines, whether the possessor can appear in the nominative case, as in Hungarian (1) or in Udmurt (2). Whereas example (1) also contains a 3rd person possessive suffix on the possessee, example (2) is an instance of simple juxtaposition.

>(1) Hungarian (Rounds 2013)<br/>
>***Kornél**  kalap-ja*<br/>
>Kornél.NOM  hat-3SG<br/>
>‘Kornél’s hat’<br/>

>(2) Udmurt (Edygarova 2009)<br/> 
>***val** jir*<br/> 
>horse.NOM head.NOM<br/> 
>’horse’s head’<br/> 

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if in the attributive construction the possessor can appear in the nominative case to express some central function of possession (e.g. physical possession, body-part or kinship relations). The answer is '0' if it is possible only in limited/lexicalized instances.
