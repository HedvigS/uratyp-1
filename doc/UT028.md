**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of deontic necessity?**

Deontic necessity can be associated with the expression of deontic obligation (‘need to’). In the respective case, the speaker asserts that a proposition is necessarily true (relative to some information or knowledge). In Tundra Nenets, necessitative is one of the several moods (1).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated marker used to express necessity. The answer is '0' if necessity may only be conveyed using an analytical construction.
