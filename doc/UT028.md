**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of deontic necessity?**

Deontic necessity can be associated with deontic obligation (‘need to’). In the case of deontic necessity, the speaker asserts that a proposition is necessarily true, relative to some information or knowledge. In Tundra Nenets, necessitative is one of the several moods. In Mari, there is a derivational suffix to indicate necessity.

>‘Whatever happens, we should go together.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated marker used to express of necessity. The answer is '0' if necessity may only be conveyed by using an analytical construction.
