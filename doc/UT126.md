**Is there stress in heavy syllables?**

Heavy syllables have the structure _VV_ and _VC_ (i.e. syllables contain a long vowel, diphthong, or end in consonant). In some languages, such syllables tend to attract word stress.

>Meadow Mari<br/>
>кокырыкˈташ [kokɤ̘rɤ̘-kˈt-ɑʃ] cough-derCAUS-INF ‘make someone cough’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if heavy syllables tend to attract word stress.
