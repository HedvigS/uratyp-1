**Does the marking of the object depend on the verb conjugation form?**

The marking of the object may also depend on a verb form (see also UT010 and UT011), e.g. imperative, impersonal, negative form of a verb may require a particular case. In Estonian, with imperative and impersonal verb forms the object occurs in the nominative (1a), whereas with negation partitive marking is used (1b).

>a. *Võta         võti!*<br/>
>   take.IMP.2SG  key.NOM<br/>
>   ‘Take the key’

>b. *Ära          võta      võti-t!*<br/>
>   NEG.IMP.2SG   take.CNG  key-PRT<br/>
>   ‘Don’t take the key!’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the verb conjugation form influences the case selection of the object. When answering the question, only finite forms were considered; object conjugation was not considered.
