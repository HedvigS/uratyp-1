**Can subject in at least some participial subordinate clauses be encoded in the same way as in independent clauses?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to mark the subject in participial subordinate clauses and in independent clauses the same way. 

The answer is Y if there are at least some examples of participial subordinate clauses, where the subject is marked the same way as the subject in independent clauses. Typically, one would expect the nominative marking.

In Meadow Mari, the nominative case may be used to express the participial clause subject. As the nominative is also used to mark the subject in independent clauses, the answer is Y.

Hungarian is an example of a language where both options occur. Thus for Hungarian, the answer is Y:
1) Az Anna említette könyv nagyon érdekesnek tűnik 
2) az  [Anna  által  tegnap   olvas-ott]   könyv (Kenesei et al. 1998: 46)
DEF.ART  Anna  by  yesterday  read-PTCP.PST  book
‘the book read by Anna yesterday’
In the second sentence, the subject is encoded as a certain non-core participant (see postposition által). If in a language there are only examples of the second type, the answer is N.
