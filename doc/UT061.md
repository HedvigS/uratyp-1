**Can subject in at least some participial subordinate clauses be encoded in the same way as in independent clauses?**

This question asks whether it is possible to encode the subject in participial subordinate clauses and in independent clauses the same way. For instance, in example (1) Anna is occurs in the nominative case (as is typical to subjects in independent clauses).

(1) Hungarian
*Az Anna említ-ett-e könyv*
DEF Anna mention-PTCP-POSS.3SG book
The book mentioned by Anna

Hungarian also has the possibility to use a non-core participant containing the postposition *által*, e.g. *Anna  által* 'by Anna'. 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if at least some participial subordinate clauses show the same kind of marking as in independent clauses. If the only option to express a subject in subordinate clauses is to use a certain non-core participant (cf. *által* above), the value is '0'.
