**Is there a separate case for marking the state of being (essive), which is different from the translative?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether there is a separate case for the expression of state of being (usually called *the essive*), which is different from the case typically used to mark transition (see also UT095). In Finnish, for instance, these two meanings are encoded by different cases, called the essive (1a) and the translative (1b).

>‘She works as a teacher.’

>b. *Hän opiskel-i opettaja-ksi*<br/>

>‘She studied to become a teacher’
 
**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case for the expression of state of being (as in Finnish).
