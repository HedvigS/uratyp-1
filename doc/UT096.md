**Is there a separate case for marking the state of being (essive), which is different from the translative?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether there is a separate case for the expression of state of being, which is different from the  case typically used to mark transition. In Finnish, these two meanings are expressed by different means, called the essive (1) and the translative (2).

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän työskentelee- opettaja-**na***<br/>
>s/he work-3SG teacher-ESS<br/>
>‘She works as a teacher.’

>(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän opiskel-i opettaja-ksi*<br/>
>s/he study.-PST.3SG teacher-TRA<br/>
>‘She studied to become a teacher’
 
 The answer is '1' if there is a separate case for the expression of state of being (usually called the *essive*).
