**Is copula needed for predicate nominals in the 3rd person form of the present tense?**

Predicate nominal clauses typically express equation (*He is my father*) and proper inclusion (*He is a teacher*). The term *copula* designates a verb (see *be* in previous examples), an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements and functions as the predicate nucleus. (Payne 1997: 115; Pustet 2003: 5) The aim of this question is to find out whether predicate nominal clauses typically involve the structure NP copula NP when used for the present time reference (1). See also UT046 for past and/or future time reference.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if copula is needed/commonly used in the simplest predicate nominal constructions, i.e. the present tense. When answering the question, only 3sg forms of the present tense were considered.
