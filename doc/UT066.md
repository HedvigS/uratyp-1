**Is OV the neutral order in affirmative imperative clauses?**

The aim of this question is to find out whether OV is the neutral order in affirmative imperative clauses, as in Udmurt: 

(1) Udmurt (Nikolay Kuznetsov & Svetlana Edygarova, p.c.)<br/>
>*чай ю!<br/> 
>[t͡ɕɑj ju]*<br/>
>tea[ACC] drink.IMP.2SG<br/>
>'Drink tea!'

**Coding.** The value is '1' only in the case OV is the neutral order. In the case OV is possible but not neutral the value is '0'.
