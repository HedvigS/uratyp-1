**Are there verbal prefixes?**

Verbal prefixes are affixes on the verb. Unlike preverbs verbal prefixes are not separable from the base, i.e. they do not show syntactic mobility. Verbal prefixes can be attested, for instance, in Livonian (1).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there are verbal prefixes that are attached to the verb.
