**Are there verbal prefixes?**

Verbal prefixes are affixes on the verb. Unlike preverbs verbal prefixes are not separable from the base, i.e. they do not show syntactic mobility. Verbal prefixes can be attested in Livonian (1).

The answer is '1' if there are verbal prefixes that can be attached to the verb.
