**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and action nominalizations?**

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions, for instance, it is possible that there is no distinction between participles and action nominalizations (e.g. running, destruction).

The answer is Y if there is participle/action nominalization polysemy. 

Komi-Zyryan, Pechora dialect (Permic, Russia, Serdobolskaya and
Paperno 2006: 1)
[mama-li̮s’ vur-e̮m] de̮re̮m me kos’al-i
mother-GEN2 sew-PTCP shirt 1SG tear-PST
‘I’ve torn the shirt mother sewed.’

[mama-le̮n de̮re̮m vur-e̮m] meni̮m kažitс’-e̮
mother-GEN shirt sew-NMLZ 1SG.DAT like-PRS.3
‘I like the way mother has sewn the shirt.’

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions without any additional morphology. One of the options is to use a nonfinite form as a participle and as an agentive nominalizations, see Livonian examples (1a) and (1b).

>a. *a'ili-**ji*** 'runner'<br/>
>b. *a'ili-**ji** i'bbi*<br/> 
>run-AG.NMLZ  horse.NOM<br/> 
>‘a running horse’, lit. ‘a runner horse’

The answer is '1' if a nonfinite form can be used both as a participle and as an agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
