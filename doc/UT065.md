**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and converbs without any additional morphological material, such as case markers?**

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions, including as converbs. In Tundra Nenets, nonfinite forms (labelled as modal *converbs* by Nikolaeva, 2014) can function as predicates of relative clauses (1a) and adverbial clauses (1b). 

(1) Tundra Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 322, 354, 378, cited through Shagal 2018)<br/>
>a. *yil’e-s’° m’aq-m’i*<br/>
>live-CVB.MOD tent-1SG<br/>
>‘the tent in which I live’

>b. *ŋarka pæ-n°h t’ebə-° xən° wabtarey°-q*<br/>
>big stone-DAT bump.into-CVB.MOD sledge turn.over-REFL.3SG<br/>
>‘The sledge turned over after/because it bumped into a big stone.’

The answer is '1' if there is a nonfinite form can function both as a participle and as a converb without any additional morphological material.
