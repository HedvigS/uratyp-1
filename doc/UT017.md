**Is there a grammatical device for frequentative?**

The frequentative views the situation as being frequent during a certain period of time. Thus, it also includes the habitual meaning as the situation is characteristic to a certain period of time (see also UT016). The aim of this question is to find out whether frequentativity can be expressed by other than lexical means. In Mansi and Hungarian, a derivational suffix may be used:

>Mansi: *suns-* 'to watch' vs. *suns-iyl-* 'to watch repeatedly' (Riese 2001: 58)<br/>
>Hungarian: *olvas* 'to read' vs. *olvas-gat* 'to read repeatedly'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the expression of frequentativity can be clearly attributed to a grammatical device that is either inflectional, derivational or periphrastic.
