**Is there a future participle?**

To be regarded as a future participle the respective participle needs to denote an action that will/must/should be carried out or occur in the future. Such participle can be found, for instance, in Hill Mari. 

Hill Mari (RHM 2017: 162)<br/>
>***кач-шашлык** киндӹ*<br/>
>[kɑt͡ʃ-ʃɑʃlək kində̈]<br/>
>eat-PTCP.FUT bread<br/>
>'bread that will/should be eaten'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a participle that gives rise to a future interpretation (and possibly also carries modal meanining). The value is '0' if there is no such participle or ther is only a non-past participle conveying both future and present.
