**Does existential negation have a separate operator?**

The standard negation and existential negation may be expressed using the same element. However, it is also possible that existential negation employs a special negative existential predicate, which is not identical with the standard negation element, and the standard negation element cannot be applied to an existential sentence. Hunagrian is an example of such a language where existential negation and standard negation markers differ: *nincs* is used in existential sentences (1a), whereas *nem* marks standard negation (1b).

>(1) Hungarian (Rounds 2013)<br/>
>a. ***Nincs**  igazság a  Föld-ön*<br/>
>NEG justice ART world-ADE<br/>
>‘There is no justice in the world’

>b. *jövök:  **nem**  jövök*<br/>
>come:1SG :   NEG come:1SG<br/>
>'I'm coming : I'm not coming'

The answer is '1' if existential and standard negation employ different elements (as in Hungarian).
