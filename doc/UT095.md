**Is there a separate case for marking the result of change (translative) and/or a state of being (essive)?**

“Essive carries the meaning of a temporary location or state of being, often equivalent to the English “as a (child)”. Translative indicates a change in state, with the general sense of “becoming X” or “change to X”” (de Groot 2017: 6). This question asks whether there is a case that can be found in at least one of these functions. 

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Dïhte sjïdti lohkehtäjjine* ’She became a teacher’<br/>
>s/he become.PST.3SG teacher.ESS<br/>
>*Dïhte barka lohkehtäjjine* ’She works as a teacher’<br/>
>s/he work.3SG. teacher.ESS

>(2) Finnish<br/> 
>*Hän opiskel-i opettaja-ksi* ‘She studied to become a teacher’<br/>
>s/he study-PST.3SG teacher-TRA<br/>
>*Hän työskentele-e opettaja-na* ‘She works as a teacher’<br/>
>s/he work-3SG teacher-ESS

The answer is '1' if at least one of the functions is represented. Thus, South Saami as well as Finnish receive '1'. The answer is '0' if the expression of the result of change and/or state of being is a secondary function of some other case 8e.g. a local case).
