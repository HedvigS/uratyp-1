**Can 2Sg possessive suffix be used to mark definiteness?** 

Definiteness is primarily concerned with idetifiability of the referent expressed with an NP in the ongoing discourse. It is often associated with the use of lexical items (articles) but affixes also occur (Lyons 1999). One option is even to use possessive affixes, in which case they have a non-possessive meaning. This question asks weather 2Sg possessive suffixes can be used to mark definiteness, as in Forest Enets:

>Forest Enets (Khanina & Shluinsky 2017)<br/> 
>About a daughter in law: she can sew, her house is in order, she cooks, …<br/>
>*baʔa-**d** nʲe periʔ kɔlta-goo-za*<br/>
bed-OBL.SG.2SG cover always wash-dur-3SG.O:SG<br/>
‘…she always washes the bed sheets.’<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if the 2Sg possessive suffix can be used to mark definiteness. The answer is '0' if 2Sg possessive suffix does not have such a function or if possessive suffixes are not present in a language.
