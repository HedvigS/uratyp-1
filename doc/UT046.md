**Is a copula needed for predicate nominals in the past and/or future tense?**

Predicate nominals typically involve the structure NP copula NP, where *copula* usually designates a verb (see *be* in previous examples), but it may also be an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements. (Payne 1997: 115; Pustet 2003: 5) While the aim of UT0045 is to find out whether copula is needed for predicate nominal clauses expressing present time reference, this question asks whether copula is needed in semantically marked occasions, i.e. in clauses with past and/or future time referece, as in Livonian (1).

>(1) Livonian<br/>
>*Se  **vȯļ/līb** tä’m tidār mīez*<br/> 
>this be.PST.3SG/will_be.3SG 3SG:GEN daugther:GEN husband<br/>
>‘This was/will be his daugther’s husband’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if copula is needed in clauses with past and/or future time reference. When answering the question only affirmative clauses were considered.
