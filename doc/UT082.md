**Is there a dative case used to express indirect object/receiver/goal (different from a local case)?**

The dative case is often found to express recipients, benefatives/malefactives, experiencers, goals, and purposes; structurally datives tend to be associated with ditransitive indirect objects (Naess 2009: 572-573). the dative domain can be subdivided differently in various languages, there may be differences  regards the scope of its use in a language.  This question serves to determine whether there is a separate dative case, as in Livonian example (1), which is not merely a locative case used in the dative function. Namely, in Livonian in addition to the dative case there are also external and internal local cases: 

>(1) Livonian<br/>
>*Ānda sīe minn-**õn***<br/>
>give.IMP.2SG this.GEN I-DAT<br/>
>‘Give it to me’

To compare, in Estonian, the local case - allative - is used to mark the recipient/goal, e.g. *minu-le* (I-ALL) ‘to me’. 

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is a dative case, which is different from a local case. If the dative functions are expressed by other cases / there is no separate dative case, the answer is '0'.
