**Is there a genitive case that has an affix?**

The aim of this question is to find out, whether there is a genitive case, which also has an affix, as in Erzya example (1). To compare, the Estonian genitive forms that only reveal the root vowel.

>(1) Erzya (Aasmäe 2012)<br/>
>*Erzya kalo-*ń* jam*<br/>
>fish-GEN soup<br/>
>‘fish soup’ 

The answer is '1' only if there is an affix.
