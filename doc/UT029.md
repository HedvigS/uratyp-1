**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of epistemic possibility?** 

Epistemic modality can be defined as “speaker’s evaluation of the likelihood of a state of affairs” (Nuyts 2001: xv), e.g. *Jane is probably/may be at work*. Thus, the speaker holds that the proposition that Jane is at work is not certain (only a mere possibility), relative to what s/he knows or to his/her evidence.

>*Asia  ratken-nee  huomenna*<br/>
>thing resolev-POT.3SG tomorrow<br/>
>‘The thing should be resolved tomorrow.’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if epistemic possibility can be expressed using inflectional or derivational means.
