# Uralic Typological (UraTyp) datasets

The UraTyp datasets include information on 360 features spanning the domains of morphology, syntax, phonology, and lexicon collected from all the branches of the Uralic languages. 195 out of 360 features were collected using the Grambank (GB) list of features, which was developed by the Grambank team to collect data from about half of the world’s languages (https://glottobank.org/). The remaining 165 features (i.e. the UT list of features)were developed by the author team of the UraTyp database to further explore the variation within the Uralic language family. The interactive database built on these datasets is available at https://uralic.clld.org.

# Overview

Building the UraTyp database and developing the UT list of features has its origins in the typology dataset compiled by the research initiative BELDAN (Biological Evolution and the Diversification of Languages, www.bedlan.net) thanks to seed money allocated by Kone Foundation in 2013. The actual work with building the database started in 2018 within the framework of the project Kipot ja kielet ‘Pots and languages’ (funded by the University of Turku in 2018–2020) as a joint initiative between the University of Turku, University of Tartu, and Uppsala University. It also involved cooperation with the global Grambank (GB) initiative as the UT list of features was meant to supplement the GB list of features. The latter was developed at the Department of Cultural and Linguistic Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In order to make the two datasets compatible, cooperation also meant following the general principles of coding used by the Grambank team.

The process of developing the UT list of features and collecting the data was coordinated by Miina Norvik. The features were designed and managed by Gerson Klumpp, Helle Metslang, Miina Norvik, Karl Pajusalu, and Eva Saar. The GB principles were introduced by Harald Hammarström, Michael Dunn, and Rogier Blokland. Feedback for the UT list of features was provided by Jeremy Bradley and Ksenia Shagal. The UT questions were coded by Miina Norvik, Minerva Piha, and Eva Saar. The Uralic data collected using the GB list of features was mostly done by Richard Kowalik, and partly also by Miina Norvik. Both the UT as well as GB deatures were mainly coded with the help of language experts, the project members themselves also acted as language experts. The full list of contributors acting as language experts is presented in the table above. The table below also shows which of the languages have been covered by both datasets, which are currently covered only by one dataset.

To ensure consistency in coding the features it was necessary to agree on several coding-related principles, such as the linguistic variety or the ‘doculect’ one is coding. The doculect is defined as a ‘documented lect’ described in a specific source (Cysouw & Good 2013). Any grammar or data source will inherently reflect a certain linguistic variety, also with respect to time/a chronolect. Our decision was to code the modern-day standard language whenever possible; if something was very prominent in the spoken langauge, this was also considered. As regards Uralic languages that are not in active use anymore (e.g. Ingrian), have gone extinct (Kamas) or have no literary standard but exist in the form of several dialects (e.g. Ludic), we chose one particular language variety and considered what is/was characteristic or more widely spread in it. In some instances, this meant coding the language of the mid-20th century. Still, the (written) material used to code Eastern Mansi is older than 100 years. Foreign influence was another issue that had to be dealt with in several occasions. We decided not to consider very recent foreign influence or loss of features that goes hand in hand with language death. Still, as it was not always easy to decide the comments section was used to provide extra information whenever needed.   

The primary goal was to have the questions as clear and specific as possible, e.g. *Is copula needed for predicate nominals in the 3rd person form of the present tense?* only asks about the 3rd person form in the present tense. Asking for a presence/absence of a feature or function was preferred over using a term that might be put into different uses depending on a tradition of a language description (e.g. case names). Occasionally it was necessary to specify in the description what and how to code. For instance, in the case of questions on differential object marking it was asked to only consider finite clauses. All the information about the coding procedure is included in the accompanying descriptions that are made available in the user interface (https://uralic.clld.org/). 

As features in both questionnaires were formed as binary questions designed to be answered with “yes, this function/feature is present in the language” or “no, this function/feature is not present in the language” the two datasets could be easily joined to form a single coherent database. 
Differently from the data collecetd with the GB questionnaire, the UT data is also provided with examples whenever a feature was present. This were seen as a valuable addition. Furthermore, examples proved very useful whenever there was a need to make changes. The examples were usually extracted by the language expert, or by the coder and afterwards checked with the language expert. These examples originate from various kinds of sources: grammar books and sketches, language corpora, research articles, text collections etc.; in the case the language expert was a native speaker, constructed examples were also allowed. Examples illustrating morphological or syntactic features were provided with glosses, while phonological characteristics are presented using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Additional information is provided in the Comment column. All the sources that were used for answering the UT questions are presented in a separate file 

The UraTyp database is the first comprehensive database that presents comparative structural data on the Uralic language family from all its branches. 
We hope that the database proves to be a useful tool in research and teaching for typologists, Uralists, as well as everyone else interested in the Uralic languages. 

# Contents
The raw version of the dataset (found in the **`raw`** folder of the repository) is organized into folders and tables; the data structure is described below in detail. All tables are provided as separate CSV (comma-separated values) files.

### `UT`

This folder contains files that constitute the UT part of the UraTyp.<br/>
1. `Features.csv`<br/> 
Includes features, i.e. questions used to collect the UT data; the first column also provides the feature ID. The last column specifies the broader area (phonology, morphology, syntax, or lexicon) under which the feature can be subsumed.<br/>

Detailed descriptions of features can be found in the `doc` folder. Each description also contains information on what was considered when coding the respective feature.

2. `Finaldata.csv`<br/>
Presents all the data collected using the UT questionnaire in one table. It includes the information on languages, their subfamilies, and the values (answers) for each feature (represented only by question ID). 

3. `language_tables`<br/>
This folder contains a separate table for each language from where the data was collected. The information in the tables is organized as follows:<br/>
(i) the `ID` of the feature<br/>
(ii) the `name`of the feature<br/> 
(iii) the answer, i.e. value represented as 1 'yes', 0 'no', ? 'no information', or N/A 'not applicable'<br/>
(iv) the `source` of information<br/>
(v) an `example` whenever the answer is 1 'yes'; the examples falling in the area of morphology or syntax are provided with glosses, while phonological examples are provided with the International Phonetic Alphabet<br/>
(vi) a `comment` whenever necessary.

The literary sources used to fill out the language tables are included in the BibTeX file `UT_sources.bib`. Whenever the information as regards the answer, example, and a comment came from the language expert, the name of the expert is represented in source column. The list of people who acted as language experts can be obtained from the file `Contributors.md`.

### `GB`

This folder contains files that constitute the GB part of the UraTyp.

1. `Features.csv`

2. `Finaldata.csv`

### `Languages.csv`

This file contains information on the languages from where the data was collected using the UT questionnaire and/or GB questionnaire. The table includes the names of the languages, their subfamilies, Glottocodedes, ISO language codes, latitudes and longitudes.
