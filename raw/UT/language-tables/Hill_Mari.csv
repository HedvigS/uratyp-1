UT006,Can adpositions be used to mark core verbal arguments?,0,Jeremy Bradley (p.c. 2020),,
UT007,Can adpositions be used to mark non-core/oblique verbal arguments?,1,RHM 225-226,UT007,It could however be reasoned that postpositions that encode oblique arguments have been subject to morphologization and that it is only description tradition and orthographic norms that prevent them from being considered case suffixes (see EG 163-164).
