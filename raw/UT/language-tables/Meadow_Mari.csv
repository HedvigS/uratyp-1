UT001,Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?,0,EG 198,,
UT002,Is non-agreement in number between the nominal subject and verbal predicate possible?,1,EG 57,UT002,"“On occasion, a grammatically singular noun that refers to a group of sorts (e.g., калык [kɑlək] ‘people’, кӱтӱ [kyty] ‘herd’, еш [jeʃ] ‘family’), or pair nouns/collective nouns [...], co-occur with plural forms of verbs. In these cases, singular verbal forms are however also possible, and recommended by prescriptive grammarians.”"

UT007,Can adpositions be used to mark non-core/oblique verbal arguments?,1,"EG 163-164, 172",UT007,It could however be reasoned that postpositions that encode oblique arguments have been subject to morphologization and that it is only description tradition and orthographic norms that prevent them from being considered case suffixed (EG 163-164).
UT008,Can non-finite clauses entail a special way for a core argument (S/A) marking?,1,EG 254,UT008,"“The gerunds in -мек(е) [-mek(e)] and -меш(ке) [-meʃ(ke)] take possessive suffixes; their agent, which can (but does not have to) differ from the agent of the superordinate (often finite) verb, can be marked by a preceding pronoun or noun. If the agent of the gerundial action is a noun, it can be in the nominative or the genitive. Inanimate nouns generally occur in the nominative, while animate nouns occur in either the nominative or genitive. When used with a genitive form, the gerund usually has a possessive suffix third person.” (EG 254) The same applies to participles (EG 261, 265, 266); the picture is more complicated with postpositions (EG 160) where the government depends on the individual postposition."

UT165,Is there radical qualitative consonant gradation?,0,EG 34,,"There is alternation between [t] and [d] (not marked in orthography; д is used regardless of pronunciation) that has been said to resembles consonant gradation or final consonant devoicing: кид [kit] ‘hand’, кит-лан [kit-lɑn] hand-PX1PL, кид-ем [kid-em] hand-PX1SG. However, the historical explanation here is that [d] was spirantized to [ð] between vowels, and was later replaced by [d] under Russian influence."
