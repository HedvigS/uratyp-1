UT001,Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?,1,Beáta Wagner-Nagy (p.c. 2020),,"There is an agreement with the logical subject. In the comitative construction the agreement is dual (plural), however a few instances of singular. the verb is always in dual if the subject in a pronoun in dual. If there are two grammatical subjects (such as my mother and my father) in a sentence, the predicate is in the dual. This expresses that the two subjects act together. After quantifiers such as ŋukəgəə ‘many, much’, bǝnsǝ ‘all’ or numerals, the predicate agrees formally with the subject, i.e. it appears in the singular."
