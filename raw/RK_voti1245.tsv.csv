GB051	Is there a noun class/gender system where sex is a factor in class assignment?	Relevant category here does not have to mean that it's the absolute deciding factor when assigning a noun to a certain gender/NC, but that there is a clear preference for certain nouns to have a certain gender/NC.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB052	Is there a noun class/gender system where shape is a factor in class assignment?	Relevant category here does not have to mean that it's the absolute deciding factor when assigning a noun to a certain gender/NC, but that there is a clear preference for certain nouns to have a certain gender/NC.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB053	Is there a noun class/gender system where animacy is a factor in class assignment?

GB057	Are there numeral classifiers?	This does not concern whether or not numerals agree with the noun class of the head they modify. This question concerns whether there exists a independent classifier system in numerals that is not related to the other classifier systems.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB058	Are there possessive classifiers?	This does not concern whether or not possessive markers agree with the noun class of the possessum. This question concerns whether there exists a independent classifier system in possessive markers that is not related to the other classifier systems. We are concerned both with markers that signal the nature of the possessor or the possessum, and the relationship between them. Differences in the expression of individual, joint, separate and group possession is not relevant here. This feature applies to both pronominal and nominal possessors. Possessive classifiers need not be obligatory, it can also be possible to construct possessive phrases with no classification of nominals into different categories.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB059	Is the adnominal possessive construction different for alienable and inalienable nouns?	Is there a morpho-syntactic difference in attributive possession that can be attributed to alienability? This feature applies to both pronominal and nominal possessors.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB065	What is the pragmatically unmarked order of adnominal possessor noun and possessed noun?	In a pragmatically unmarked construction, i.e. not focus. This feature applies to both pronominal and nominal possessors.	multistate 1:Possessor-Possessed; 2:Possessed-Possessor; 3: both	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB068	Do core adjectives (defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension) act like verbs in predicative position?	Do elements expressing predicate adjectival meaning take on verbal morphology? The adjectival roots need not take exactly all verbal marking, if there is at least some marking that verbal and adjectival roots share then there is a yes here. For example: ""he runs"" and ""he greens"".	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB069	Do core adjectives (defined semantically as property concepts; value, shape, age, dimension) used attributively require the same morphological treatment as verbs?	Do elements expressing attributive adjectival meaning receive the same treatment as verbs when verbs are used attributively, i.e. inside an NP? The adjectival roots need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adjectival roots share then there is a yes here. The result need not be finite, participles would count if that is the way verbs are marked when used attributively. This means that if the language in question forms modifying verbs by participles (“running man”) and this is the same for adjectival roots (“redding man”) then there is a yes here.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB070	Are there morphological cases for non-pronominal core arguments (i.e. S/A/P)?	Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is phonologically bound (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, ...). Core arguments are those having S, A or P (or O, in some traditions) function.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB071	Are there morphological cases for pronominal core arguments (i.e. S/A/P)?	Core pronouns are the NPs required by the verb to be present, typically S, A or O.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB072	Are there morphological cases for oblique non-pronominal NPs (i.e. not S/A/P)?	Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is phonologically bound (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, ...). Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P (or O, in some traditions), e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, ... Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases in Grambank.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB073	Are there morphological cases for oblique independent personal pronouns (i.e. not S/A/P)?	Morphological case involves any type of case marking that is phonologically bound (affixes, clitics, tone, alternation, vowel lengthening, ...). Oblique NPs are NPs having a function other than S, A or P (or O, in some traditions), e.g. dative, locative, ablative instrumental, comitative, location in time, ... Note that genitive or possessive are not seen as cases in Grambank.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB074	Are there prepositions?	Prepositions mark core or oblique noun phrases. Proclitics count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that phonological boundedness is not relevant to this question. If there is only one preposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB075	Are there postpositions?	Postpositions mark core or oblique noun phrases. Enclitics count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that phonological boundedness is not relevant to this question. If there is only one postposition, this is enough for a 1 here.	1: present, 0: absent	1	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB079	Do verbs have prefixes/proclitics, other than those that ONLY mark A, S or O (do include portmanteau: A & S + TAM)?	The portmanteau morphemes in questions could be of person, number or TAM or markers of reciprocity, location, benefactive, direction etc. If there are affixes devoted to TAM solely these are also counted. Person markings expression more than one argument, relative markers or relative pronouns are also included here if they form a phonological units with the root. The outcome of this affixation has to be a finite verb, i.e. an affix that makes a verb into an instrumental noun for example would not count. This feature is not logically triggered by the following features, but if you have coded ""1"" for either of these you are advised to consider whether it would also result in a ""1"" for this feature: 152, 101, 151, 149, 82, 83, 84, 87, 88, 107, 104, 103, 147, 148, 114 and 115. The reason why there is no strict logical dependency is because while they all deal with markings on the verb, these can theoretically be other markings than prefixes, proclitics, enclitics or suffixes (reduplication, tone and suppletion). Since this kind of marking is rare, we recommend all coders being aware of this link even though it is not technically a strict dependency.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB080	Do verbs have suffixes/enclitics, other than those that ONLY mark A, S or O (do include portmanteau: A & S + TAM)?

GB081	Is there productive infixation in verbs?	This affix is stem internal, not between other affixes. Kashaya is a languge that illustrates this principle well.	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB082	Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?	This question aims at capturing overt productive paradigms of tense. ""On the verb"" here means that the marker has to form a phonological unit with the roots. This could refer to an affix, but suppletion, tonal marking and reduplication is also included.This feature aims at capturing over marking of present tense on the verb, i.e. lack of other markings is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary, for example some grammarians state that future tense is accomplished by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is the productive grammatical obligatory way of expression the tense in question than such a construction is allowed to trigger yes (1) for both ""on the verb ""and ""auxiliary"".	1: present, 0: absent	0	Heinike Heinsoo, p.c. 	
GB083	Is there overt morphological marking on the verb dedicated to past tense?	This question aims at capturing overt productive paradigms of tense. ""On the verb"" here means that the marker has to form a phonological unit with the roots.
